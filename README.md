# MedicalDrugReviewsAnalysis
As there is a lack of genuine reviews and ratings on the internet which make it arduous to correctly analyse the effectiveness of the given drug. In order to address this problem, I made this project on “Drug user sentiment extraction” using a strongly labelled dataset for which contains 362807 instances with features: age-group, gender, condition, date, drug, drugID, sex, satisfaction, useful count, effectiveness, ease of use and side effects. I used supervised Machine Learning algorithms like: KNN, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes combinedly with n-gram models to correctly classify the reviews.
